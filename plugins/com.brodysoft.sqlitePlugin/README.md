# Cordova/PhoneGap SQLitePlugin

Native interface to sqlite in a Cordova/PhoneGap plugin for Android/iOS/WP(8), with HTML5 Web SQL API

License for Android & WP(8) versions: MIT or Apache 2.0

License for iOS version: MIT only

## WARNING: breaking change for Android version

The automatic "`.db`" database file extension is [now removed](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/commit/3723cfc2dc933ae128fe9d5998efe4d76fcb0370) for the Android version, for consistency with the other versions. For an existing app, you may have to open an existing database like:

```js
var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
```

Also the threading model is changed as described below.

## Status

- WP8 version is now integrated for the PhoneGap build (ref: #99)
- Please use the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) for community support
- Commercial support is available for SQLCipher integration with Android & iOS versions

## Announcements

- WP(8) version is now working with CSharp-SQLite library classes (which are embedded & built from source) and passing most of the tests.
- Changes to background processing:
  - The `dbType` option is now removed;
  - Android version is now using one thread per db;
  - for iOS version backround processing using a thread pool is now mandatory;
  - for WP(8) version, background processing with one thread per transaction.
- Fixes to work with PouchDB by [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson)
- Forum renamed to: [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin)
- New location: https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin
- iOS version can now be built with either ARC or MRC.

## Highlights

- Works with Cordova 3.x tooling
- Drop-in replacement for HTML5 SQL API, the only change should be `window.openDatabase()` --> `sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()`
- Failure-safe nested transactions with batch processing optimizations
- As described in [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/cordovaphonegap-sqlite-plugins-offer.html):
  - Keeps sqlite database in a user data location that is known, can be reconfigured, and iOS will be backed up by iCloud.
  - No 5MB maximum, more information at: http://www.sqlite.org/limits.html
- Android & iOS working with [SQLCipher](http://sqlcipher.net) for encryption (see below)
- Android is supported back to SDK 10 (a.k.a. Gingerbread, Android 2.3.3); Support for older versions is available upon request.

## Some apps using Cordova/PhoneGap SQLitePlugin

- [Tangorin](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tangorin.app) (Android) Japanese Dictionary at [tangorin.com](http://tangorin.com/)

## Known issues

- Deleting a database is not (yet) implemented for WP(8).
- db.executeSql() calls callback multiple times
- issues with db.close() & sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase()
- using web workers is currently not supported and known to be broken on Android

## Other limitations

- The db version, display name, and size parameter values are not supported and will be ignored.
- The sqlite plugin will not work before the callback for the "deviceready" event has been fired, as described in **Usage**.
- For iOS, iCloud backup is NOT optional and should be.
- The Android version cannot work with more than 100 open db files due to its threading model.
- Missing db creation callback
- Multi-page architecture is not (yet) supported.

## Other versions

- Pre-populated database support for Android & iOS: https://github.com/RikshaDriver/Cordova-PrePopulated-SQLitePlugin
- Original version for iOS, with a different API: https://github.com/davibe/Phonegap-SQLitePlugin

## Using with SQLCipher

- for Android version: [this blog posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/using-sqlcipher-for-android-with.html) & [enhancements to SQLCipher db classes for Android](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/enhancements-to-sqlcipher-db-classes.html)
- for iOS version: [this posting](http://brodyspark.blogspot.com/2012/12/integrating-sqlcipher-with.html)

**NOTE:** This documentation is out-of-date and to be replaced very soon.

# Usage

The idea is to emulate the HTML5 SQL API as closely as possible. The only major change is to use window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase() (or sqlitePlugin.openDatabase()) instead of window.openDatabase(). If you see any other major change please report it, it is probably a bug.

## Opening a database

There are two options to open a database:
- Recommended: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});`
- Classical: `var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("myDatabase.db", "1.0", "Demo", -1);`

**IMPORTANT:** Please wait for the "deviceready" event, as in the following example:

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});
  // ...
}
```

**NOTE:** The database file name should include the extension, if desired.

## Background processing

The threading model depens on which version is used:
- For Android, one background thread per db, always;
- for iOS, background processing using a thread pool (always);
- for WP(8) version, background processing with one thread per transaction, which is internally spawned by the Cordova library.

# Sample with PRAGMA feature

This is a pretty strong test: first we create a table and add a single entry, then query the count to check if the item was inserted as expected. Note that a new transaction is created in the middle of the first callback.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase({name: "my.db"});

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    // demonstrate PRAGMA:
    db.executeSql("pragma table_info (test_table);", [], function(res) {
      console.log("PRAGMA res: " + JSON.stringify(res));
    });

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      db.transaction(function(tx) {
        tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
          console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
          console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
        });
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

## Sample with transaction-level nesting

In this case, the same transaction in the first executeSql() callback is being reused to run executeSql() again.

```js
// Wait for Cordova to load
document.addEventListener("deviceready", onDeviceReady, false);

// Cordova is ready
function onDeviceReady() {
  var db = window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase("Database", "1.0", "Demo", -1);

  db.transaction(function(tx) {
    tx.executeSql('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS test_table');
    tx.executeSql('CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_table (id integer primary key, data text, data_num integer)');

    tx.executeSql("INSERT INTO test_table (data, data_num) VALUES (?,?)", ["test", 100], function(tx, res) {
      console.log("insertId: " + res.insertId + " -- probably 1");
      console.log("rowsAffected: " + res.rowsAffected + " -- should be 1");

      tx.executeSql("select count(id) as cnt from test_table;", [], function(tx, res) {
        console.log("res.rows.length: " + res.rows.length + " -- should be 1");
        console.log("res.rows.item(0).cnt: " + res.rows.item(0).cnt + " -- should be 1");
      });

    }, function(e) {
      console.log("ERROR: " + e.message);
    });
  });
}
```

This case will also works with Safari (WebKit), assuming you replace window.sqlitePlugin.openDatabase with window.openDatabase.

## Delete a database

```js
window.sqlitePlugin.deleteDatabase("my.db", successcb, errorcb);
```

**NOTE:** This is not implemented for WP(8).

# Installing

**NOTE:** This plugin is now prepared to be installed using the `cordova` tool.

## Easy install with cordova tool

    npm install -g cordova # if you don't have cordova
    cordova create MyProjectFolder com.my.project MyProject && cd MyProjectFolder # if you are just starting
    cordova plugin add https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin

You can find more details at [this writeup](http://iphonedevlog.wordpress.com/2014/04/07/installing-chris-brodys-sqlite-database-with-cordova-cli-android/).

## Source tree

- `SQLitePlugin.coffee.md`: platform-independent (Literate coffee-script, can be read by recent coffee-script compiler)
- `www`: `SQLitePlugin.js` now platform-independent
- `src`: Java plugin code for Android; Objective-C plugin code for iOS; C-sharp code & DLLs for WP(8)
- `test-www`: simple testing in `index.html` using qunit 1.5.0
- `Lawnchair-adapter`: Lawnchair adaptor, based on the version from the Lawnchair repository, with the basic Lawnchair test suite in `test-www` subdirectory

## Manual installation - Android version

These installation instructions are based on the Android example project from Cordova/PhoneGap 2.7.0. For your first time please unzip the PhoneGap 2.7 zipball and use the `lib/android/example` subdirectory.

 - Install www/SQLitePlugin.js from this repository into assets/www subdirectory
 - Install src/android/org/pgsqlite/SQLitePlugin.java from this repository into src/org/pgsqlite subdirectory
 - Add the plugin element `<plugin name="SQLitePlugin" value="org.pgsqlite.SQLitePlugin"/>` to res/xml/config.xml

Sample change to res/xml/config.xml for Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x:

```

Before building for the first time, you have to update the project with the desired version of the Android SDK with a command like:

    android update project --path $(pwd) --target android-17

(assume Android SDK 17, use the correct desired Android SDK number here)

**NOTE:** using this plugin on Cordova pre-3.0 requires the following change to SQLitePlugin.java:

```

## Manual installation - iOS version

### SQLite library

In the Project "Build Phases" tab, select the _first_ "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menu and add the library `libsqlite3.dylib` or `libsqlite3.0.dylib`.

**NOTE:** In the "Build Phases" there can be multiple "Link Binary with Libraries" dropdown menus. Please select the first one otherwise it will not work.

### SQLite Plugin

Drag .h and .m files into your project's Plugins folder (in xcode) -- I always
just have "Create references" as the option selected.

Take the precompiled javascript file from build/, or compile the coffeescript
file in src/ to javascript WITH the top-level function wrapper option (default).

Use the resulting javascript file in your HTML.

Enable the SQLitePlugin in `config.xml` (Cordova/PhoneGap 2.x):

# Common traps & pitfalls

- The plugin class name starts with "SQL" in capital letters, but in Javascript the `sqlitePlugin` object name starts with "sql" in small letters.
- Attempting to open a database before receiving the "deviceready" event callback.

# Support

## Reporting issues

If you have an issue with the plugin please check the following first:
- You are using the latest version of the Plugin Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C source from this repository.
- You have installed the Javascript & platform-specific Java or Objective-C correctly.
- You have included the correct version of the cordova Javascript and SQLitePlugin.js and got the path right.
- You have registered the plugin properly in `config.xml`.

If you still cannot get something to work:
- Make the simplest test program you can to demonstrate the issue, including the following characteristics:
  - it completely self-contained, i.e. it is using no extra libraries beyond cordova & SQLitePlugin.js;
  - if the issue is with *adding* data to a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database and create the table;
  - if the issue is with *retrieving* data from a table, that the test program includes the statements you used to open the database, create the table, and enter the data you are trying to retrieve.

Then you can post the issue to the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) or [raise a new issue](https://github.com/brodysoft/Cordova-SQLitePlugin/issues/new).

## Community forum

If you have any questions about the plugin please post it to the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin).

## Support priorities

**High priority:**

1. Stability is first: immediate resolution or workaround for stability issues (crashing) is the goal.
2. Correctness: any issue with correctness should result in a new testcase together with the bug fix.

**Low priority:** issues with the API or application integration will be given lower priority until the Cordova 3.0 integration is finished for Windows Phone 8. Pull requests are very welcome for these kinds of issues.

## Professional support

Available for integration with SQLCipher.

# Unit test(s)

Unit testing is done in `test-www/`. To run the tests, simply do either:

    ./bin/test.sh ios

or in Android:

    ./bin/test.sh android

# Adapters

## Lawnchair Adapter

### Common adapter

Please look at the `Lawnchair-adapter` tree that contains a common adapter, which should also work with the Android version, along with a test-www directory.

### Included files

Include the following js files in your html:

-  lawnchair.js (you provide)
-  SQLitePlugin.js
-  Lawnchair-sqlitePlugin.js (must come after SQLitePlugin.js)

### Sample

The `name` option will determine the sqlite filename. Optionally, you can change it using the `db` option.

In this example, you would be using/creating the database at: *Documents/kvstore.sqlite3* (all db's in SQLitePlugin are in the Documents folder)

```coffee
kvstore = new Lawnchair { name: "kvstore" }, () ->
  # do stuff
```

Using the `db` option you can create multiple stores in one sqlite file. (There will be one table per store.)

```coffee
recipes = new Lawnchair {db: "cookbook", name: "recipes", ...}
ingredients = new Lawnchair {db: "cookbook", name: "ingredients", ...}
```

It also supports bgType argument:

```coffee
users = new Lawnchair {name: "users", bgType: 1, ...}
```

### PouchDB

The adapter is now part of [PouchDB](http://pouchdb.com/) thanks to [@nolanlawson](https://github.com/nolanlawson), see [PouchDB FAQ](http://pouchdb.com/faq.html).

# Contributing

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** It is better to push your change(s) from a separate branch. Sometimes they need to be reworked before acceptance. Otherwise your `master` branch could become a real mess if rework is needed.

- Testimonials of apps that are using this plugin would be especially helpful.
- Reporting issues to the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) can help improve the quality of this plugin.
- Patches with bug fixes are helpful, especially when submitted with test code.
- Other enhancements welcome for consideration, when submitted with test code and will work for all supported platforms. Increase of complexity should be avoided.
- All contributions may be reused by [@brodybits (Chris Brody)](https://github.com/brodybits) under another license in the future. Efforts will be taken to give credit for major contributions but it will not be guaranteed.
- Project restructuring, i.e. moving files and/or directories around, should be avoided if possible. If you see a need for restructuring, it is best to ask first on the [Cordova-SQLitePlugin forum](http://groups.google.com/group/Cordova-SQLitePlugin) where alternatives can be discussed before reaching a conclusion. If you want to propose a change to the project structure:
  - Make a special branch within your fork from which you can send the proposed restructuring;
  - Always use `git mv` to move files & directories;
  - Never mix a move/rename operation and any other changes in the same commit.

## Major branches

- `common-src` - source for Android & iOS versions
- `master-src` - source for Android, iOS, & WP(8) versions
- `master-rc` - pre-release version, including source for CSharp-SQLite library classes
- `master` - version for release, will be included in PhoneGap build.
